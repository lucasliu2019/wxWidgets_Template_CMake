This template use VSCode for wxWidgets libary in C/C++, the complilation is done using CMake.


## Requirement
Required tools:
- CMake (to create makefile and import libarary)
- VSCode (optional)

Required libarary:
- wxWidgets (for GUIs)

### installation and setup of Raylib
For linux, we use brew commend to install the raylib libary. 
```sh
brew install wxwidgets 
```


### installation and setup of VSCode
For VSCode, we will install the extension called CMake Tools. This extension will help use to comiple the source code using CMake according to the setups in "CMakeLists.txt".


## Compile the code
Note taht VSCode is optional, you could directly use CMake. To use VSCode, we first open the folder of the project, the file ogranization is shown in the next Section "File Structre". Once the folder is open in VSCode. Click the CMake extension. Next, we click "Delete Cache and Reconfiguration" icon beside the "PROJECT STSTUS" tab. Once it is succesfullly built, we can run/compile our project in the "PROJECT OUTLINE" tab. Find the excutable 'myGame' and right click to run/debug. 

We can change the compiled project name by changing 'myGame' to desired project name in the 2nd line in CMakeLists.txt
```
project(myGame)
```

## File structure
The structure of the files is organized in following way:
```
project
│   README.md
│   CMakeLists.txt    
│
└───src
│   │   main.cpp
│   │   ...
│   
└───build (genered by CMake)
    │   ...
    │
```

There is no build foler initially, and it is generated by CMake. The excutable file is located in the build folder in the project folder.
